## IMPORTANT

**This project is being archived and replaced with the [Build Xamarin apps with the Microsoft Graph SDK training](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-xamarin). As part of the archival process, we're closing all open issues and pull requests.**

**You can continue to use this sample "as-is", but it won't be maintained moving forward. We apologize for any inconvenience.**
